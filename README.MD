# Simple HTTP / HTTPs Server

Purpose of this project is test the Authentication on the websites or common responses..


## How to Install

You can simply run:
 ```
 npm install
 npm start
 ```

Also I have nodemon in `npm run dev` if you're willing to use with nodemon.

If you create/add/change the endpoints you can edit swagger definitions as comments and run `npm run swagger-autogen` for create the modified Swagger page.
